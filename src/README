FreeDBd is a daemon which understand the FreeDB protocol and will return
disc information based on queries it recieves.

It is somehow different from the main freedb.org server, as:

- It is very lightweight, designed for personal use only
- Disc specified in text or XML source files

It is written in C and requires libxml2 for XML support (which is optional),
can be enabled by running configure with --with-xml.

I wrote this because my internet connection at home is broken, and I can't
stand seeing CD's being identified as 'Unknown Artist / Unknown Album',
Unknown Track $n :-)

You can find sample databases in the examples/ directory. Some Perl-based
tools are in the tools/ directory.

The code should be very understandable and provide good pointers at how to do
network communication, auto{conf,make} projects and libxml2 support.
